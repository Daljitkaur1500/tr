ðŸ§  TOPICS COVERED (FILE SYSTEM & EXPRESS BASICS)

Today we explored the backbone of Node.js backend development â€” the File System, Streams, and the Express.js framework.

ðŸ”¹ File System (fs) Module

Used to read and write files using fs.readFile(), fs.writeFile()

Synchronous vs asynchronous file operations

Created a basic logging app using file operations

ðŸ”¹ Streams & Events

Streams allow reading/writing large files efficiently

Used createReadStream() and createWriteStream()

Created custom events using EventEmitter

ðŸ”¹ Express.js Basics

Lightweight framework built on Node.js

Installed using npm install express

Set up a simple server using:

js
Copy
Edit
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.listen(3000);
ðŸ”¹ Middleware & Routing

Handled routes using app.get(), app.post()

Middleware used for parsing body (express.json()) and logging

ðŸ”¹ Query Parameters & Request/Response

Used query parameters like /search?q=book

Accessed data using req.query, req.params, and req.body

ðŸ”§ TOOLS USED

VS Code

Postman

Node.js + Express + Terminal

âœ… TASK FOR NEXT WEEK
Continue with Express.js routing, learn error handling, connect with MongoDB, and perform CRUD operations from the backend.
