ðŸ§  TOPICS COVERED (JS BASICS & FUNCTIONS)

Today, we officially started with JavaScript, the scripting language of the web. We explored how to declare variables, use operators, write functions, and understand how the scope and hoisting mechanism works.

ðŸ”¹ Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript makes web pages interactive and dynamic. It runs in the browser and can manipulate HTML, handle events, and fetch data from APIs.

ðŸ”¹ Variables & Data Types

Declared variables using var, let, and const

Primitive data types: Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined

Non-primitive: Object, Array, Function

ðŸ”¹ Operators
Arithmetic (+, -, *, /), Comparison (==, ===, !=), Logical (&&, ||, !)

ðŸ”¹ Functions

Declaring functions using function keyword

Parameters vs arguments

Return values and function expressions

ðŸ”¹ Scope & Hoisting

Global vs Local Scope

Hoisting: Variables and functions get moved to the top during execution

ðŸ”¹ Closures

A function remembering variables from its outer scope

Used in creating private variables or factory functions

ðŸ”§ TOOLS USED

VS Code

Chrome Developer Console

âœ… TASK FOR TOMORROW
Practice more on functions and closures. Learn how callbacks and async/await work for asynchronous code. Start working with arrays and their methods.
