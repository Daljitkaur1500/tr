ðŸ§  TOPICS COVERED (HTML BASICS)

Today, we started with the fundamentals of HTML â€“ the backbone of every webpage. We understood how HTML provides structure and meaning to content using various elements.

ðŸ”¹ Introduction to HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It consists of a set of tags that define different types of content like headings, text, links, images, lists, tables, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Structure of an HTML Page
We explored the basic skeleton of an HTML document which includes:

<!DOCTYPE html> declaration

<html>, <head>, and <body> tags

<title> for setting the page title

ðŸ”¹ HTML Elements & Attributes
We learned how elements define the content, and attributes add extra info. For example:

html
Copy
Edit
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Site</a>
ðŸ”¹ Headings & Paragraphs

HTML provides 6 levels of headings (<h1> to <h6>)

<p> tag is used for writing paragraphs

ðŸ”¹ Links & Images

Links are created using the <a> tag with an href attribute

Images are inserted using <img> with src and alt attributes

ðŸ”¹ HTML Lists
We practiced both:

Ordered lists (<ol>) â€“ for numbered items

Unordered lists (<ul>) â€“ for bullet points

ðŸ”¹ HTML Tables
We created basic tables using <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> tags. Tables help display data in rows and columns neatly.

ðŸ”§ TOOLS USED

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Chrome Browser (Live Server Extension for preview)

âœ… TASK FOR TOMORROW
Go through HTML forms, input types, and semantic tags. Also, prepare for CSS introduction â€“ syntax, selectors, and styling basics.
