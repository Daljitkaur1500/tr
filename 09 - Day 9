ðŸ§  TOPICS COVERED (APIs & NODE.JS INTRO)

This was an exciting day! We explored how the frontend communicates with backend servers through APIs and took our first steps into Node.js.

ðŸ”¹ REST API Basics

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a way of accessing web services

Common HTTP Methods:

GET: Retrieve data

POST: Send new data

PUT/PATCH: Update data

DELETE: Remove data

ðŸ”¹ Fetch API & Axios

fetch() is built-in for making HTTP requests

Axios is a third-party library with better syntax and features

Practiced GET and POST requests

ðŸ”¹ Node.js Introduction

JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 engine

Runs JavaScript on the server side

Used node filename.js to run programs in terminal

ðŸ”¹ Event Loop in Node.js

Same event loop concept as browser JS

Used for non-blocking async operations

ðŸ”¹ Modules in Node.js

Built-in modules (fs, http)

User-defined modules using require() and module.exports

ðŸ”§ TOOLS USED

VS Code

Postman for API testing

Node.js CLI

âœ… TASK FOR TOMORROW
Work with the File System module, learn about streams, and build your first Express.js server with routes and middleware.
