ðŸ§  TOPICS COVERED (ASYNC JS & ARRAYS)

We dived deeper into asynchronous programming and array manipulations â€” two of the most important skills in JavaScript.

ðŸ”¹ Callbacks & Event Handling

Callback functions used to handle events or async results

Used addEventListener() for DOM events like click, input, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Promises

Introduced as a cleaner alternative to callbacks

js
Copy
Edit
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
ðŸ”¹ Async/Await

Modern syntax to handle async code in a cleaner, readable way

js
Copy
Edit
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.json();
}
ðŸ”¹ Event Loop

Explained how JavaScript handles asynchronous code behind the scenes

Concepts of call stack, task queue, microtasks

ðŸ”¹ Arrays & Array Methods
Practiced:

map() â€“ transform each element

filter() â€“ select items based on condition

reduce() â€“ accumulate values

sort() â€“ reorder elements

ðŸ”§ TOOLS USED

VS Code

Browser Console for debugging

âœ… TASK FOR TOMORROW
Learn objects and object-oriented JS, and explore ES6+ syntax improvements. Prepare to write modular and cleaner code.
